# dMRI-muscle-sensitivity
Repository of simulation data for paper ["Global Sensitivity Analysis of Skeletal Muscle dMRI Metrics: Effects of Microstructural and Pulse Parameters"](https://doi.org/10.1002/mrm.28014) in Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.

Results for the PGSE sequence are in `sensitivity_results-PGSE.csv` and the generalized diffusion-weighted sequence (or STEAM) results are in `sensitivity_results-genDW.csv`.

To read into a multiindex dataframe in python use the command: 

`df = pd.read_csv('sensitivity_results-XXXX.csv',header=[0, 1], skipinitialspace=True)`

To generate sensitivity indices, you can use the included python notebook. You will need to install the SALib package. More info @ [https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://salib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
